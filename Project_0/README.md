### Goal of the project
Write a program to guess the number using the minimum number of attempts

**Conditions:**
- The computer thinks of an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it.  By "guess" means program that guesses a number.
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**Why to practice**
Learning to write good python code
